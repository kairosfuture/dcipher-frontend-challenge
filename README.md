# Dcipher frontend challenge

## Spec

In this challenge, you will be doing data visualization.
You are given the following sample dataset to visualize;

```json

    "AB": "This paper presents the preparation of LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 and aluminum (Al) doped LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 hollow microspheres as 5 V cathodes using monodisperse MnCO3 microspheres as precursor and template, which were synthesized using MnSO4 center dot H2O, NaHCO3 and ethanol in water at room temperature. XRD and morphology characterization results indicated that the as-prepared LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 and Al doped LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 were both spinel structure, and have particle sizes of 2-3 mu m. The cathode electrochemical properties of LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 and Al doped LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 hollow microspheres (as 5 V cathodes) were evaluated and compared by galvanostatic cycling (GC) vs. Li/Li+ at the current rate 1C in 2.7-4.8 V. The specific initial capacities of all samples were in the range of 70-120 mA h g (1). Compared to undoped LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4, Al doped LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 hollow structures can effectively improve discharge capacity (up to 140 (+/- 5) mA h g (1)) and cycling stability (70% capacity retention after 200 cycles) as high voltage cathode materials.

    "AB": "TiO2-delta-La composite nanotubes are prepared by heating the ethanol solution of La(NO3)(3)center dot 6H(2)O which is introduced into nanotube titanium acid at pre-set temperature. The effect of La dosage on the microstructure and electrochemical properties of as-fabricated TiO2-delta-La composite nanotubes is investigated. Results indicate that La3+ can be trapped in the internal/external surfaces and the interlayer space of nanotubes. All of these help to retain the nanotubular morphology and layered structure during the dehydration process. Ti3+ defects generated by the dehydration of nanotube titanium acid can be stabilized by the formed Ti-O-La bond. So, as-fabricated TiO2-delta-La composite nanotubes samples exhibit markedly improved electrochemical properties than pristine TiO2. Particularly, the electrode made of TiO2-delta-La composite nanotubes containing 5% La element (mass fraction) has a high capacity of 142 mA h g(-1) at a charge/discharge rate of 20 C rate and a capacity retention of 87% after 1000 cycles at 10 C, showing superior electrochemical performance and great potential as an anode material for high-rate lithiumion batteries.

The full dataset can be downloaded [here](add the link of dataset).

The dataset have the following fields;

- AB: Abstract of the articles
- PY: The year that the article is published
- tokens: The tokens of AB field

What we ask in this assignment is to visualize this dataset by implementing a bar chart.

- The bar chart should show the frequencies of all tokens in the dataset
- In the x axis, you can show `token.value` field
- In the y axis, you can show `count(token.value)` field
- Ability to sort bar chart data alphabetically (asc, desc)
- Ability to sort bar chart data numerically (frequencies asc, desc)
- A deployed app where we can test the challenge
- Readme instructions on how to run it locally

As you might notice, it is required to post process this dataset because we don't provide the count data.

NOTE: You can hard code the non processed data in your web app.

## Technologies to be used

- React
- D3
- Typescript
- `create-react-app` with typescript template
- Redux (optional)

Additionally, you may want to use a ui framework like material-ui or tailwindcss or a ui framework of your choice.

### Good to have

- React hooks
- Fast render performance (focus on improving render performance)
- Dockerization of app
- CI build using github actions
- Dynamic projection settings of bar chart component (ability to change projection fields like x, y, color, etc.)

### Submission of challenge

- Create a `private` github repository, add @aacanakin, @Atralbus, @zafercavdar to contributors to that repository.
- Notify us by sending an email to `info@dcipheranalytics.com`
